This dataset is constructed from a contact network amongst high school students
in Marseilles, France, in December 2013. The contact network was downloaded from
http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/high-school-contact-and-friendship-networks/

We form simplices through cliques of simultaneous contacts. Specifically, for
every unique timestamp in the dataset, we construct a simplex for every maximal
clique amongst the contact edges that exist for that timestamp. Timestamps were
recorded in 20 second intervals.
